#Customer Churn Prediction – End-to-End MLOps Project

This project implements a complete machine-learning pipeline to predict customer churn for a music streaming platform.
Given raw event logs, the system:

Cleans and preprocesses data
Builds leakage-safe behavioral features and churn labels
Trains an XGBoost model with evaluation and model tracking
Serves predictions through a FastAPI REST API
Automates retraining and registers new model versions in MLflow
Detects data drift and concept drift
Provides Docker packaging to ensure a unified runtime environment across machines

All code runs with relative paths, making it portable across devices.

1. Goal of the Project
To predict which subscribers are likely to cancel their subscription (churn) based on their recent activity behavior.
This supports:
	•	Proactive retention campaigns
	•	Targeted offers
	•	Engagement re-activation

2. Dataset & Churn Definition

Raw events are provided as JSON Lines:
	data/raw/customer_churn_mini.json

Churn detection rules
	•	A user is churn = 1 if:
			They have a "Cancellation Confirmation" event after split_time, OR
			They become inactive for 30 days after split_time
	•	Otherwise: churn = 0
Data leakage prevention
	•	Features built only from 30 days BEFORE the split
	•	Labels determined only from 30 days AFTER the split
	•	This strictly separates training signals from outcomes


3. Environment Setup (Windows + VS Code)
	python -m venv .venv
		.\.venv\Scripts\activate
	pip install -r requirements.txt

Make sure raw data exists here:
	data/raw/customer_churn_mini.json	

All paths are relative — do not use absolute paths.
Always run commands from project root.
If anything fails with imports, confirm venv is activated.

4. Full Pipeline (Raw → Features → Model)

	Step 1 — Clean raw
		python Scripts/clean_basics.py
		Creates:
			data/processed/clean_mini.parquet

	Step 2 — Build features + churn labels
		python Scripts/make_dataset.py
		Creates:
			data/processed/train_mini.parquet
			
		Columns include:
			•	songs_played
			•	thumbs_up
			•	thumbs_down
			•	add_playlist
			•	days_active
			•	recency_days
			•	churn

	Step 3 — Train + Evaluate (XGBoost)
		python Scripts/train_xgb_mlflow.py
		Saves trained model → models/xgb_model.pkl
		•	Logs metrics to MLflow (ROC-AUC, classification report)

	Step 4 — Error analysis (required)
		python Scripts/error_analysis.py
		Outputs:
			artifacts/error_analysis/metrics.json
			artifacts/error_analysis/false_negatives.csv
			artifacts/error_analysis/false_positives.csv

5. MLflow Tracking & Model Registry
	Start the UI:
		mlflow ui -p 5000 --backend-store-uri "PROJECTPATH/chrun-spotify/mlruns"
	Open browser:
		http://127.0.0.1:5000

	•	Experiment churn_xgb → manual runs
	•	Experiment churn_retrain → automated pipeline runs
	•	Registered model: xgb_churn_model
	Each retrain creates a new version of the model


6. Automated Retraining Pipeline
	Run:
		python Scripts/retrain.py
	This performs:
		1.	Clean raw data
		2.	Re-build dataset
		3.	Train new XGBoost model
		4.	Save new model → models/xgb_model.pkl
		5.	Log training to MLflow
		6.	Register model version under xgb_churn_model
		7.	Run concept drift check automatically
		8.	Log results into logs/retrain.log when launched with batch file

Optional scheduled retraining (documented, not required to run)
	retrain.bat uses relative paths and runs safely on any machine:
		Task Scheduler → Create Basic Task
		Program: C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe
		Arguments: /c "C:\Path\To\Project\retrain.bat"
		Schedule: Daily/Weekly/Hourly
This satisfies the requirement for periodic retraining.

7. Monitoring

	A) Data drift
		python Scripts/monitor_drift.py
		Detects distribution changes in new data vs training data.

	B) Concept drift (performance drop)
		Runs automatically when retrain.py finishes:
			•	Compares last two registered versions of xgb_churn_model
			•	Checks if ROC-AUC dropped by ≥ 0.05
			•	Prints ALERT if performance degrades

8. Serving Predictions (FastAPI)
	Start API:
		uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8000
	Open documentation:
		http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
	Restart API after retraining so it loads the updated model.

9. Docker Packaging (Unified Runtime Environment)
	Requirement: provide consistent runtime without manual Python setup.
	Build Docker image
		docker build -t churn-api .

	Run container
		docker run -p 8000:8000 churn-api
	Open:
		http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

	Use mounted volume to receive new model without rebuilding
	docker run -p 8000:8000 -v %cd%/models:/app/models churn-api
	This satisfies:
		Unified runtime
		No dependency installation on host
		Re-train locally and container picks up updated xgb_model.pkl


10. Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them
			Issue 						|				Explanation 				|					Fix
Scripts fail to import modules			|			venv not activated				|		.\.venv\Scripts\activate
“File not found” errors					|		incorrect working directory			|		Always run from project root
API returns 500							|	API not restarted after retraining		|			  Restart FastAPI
MLflow has no model versions			|			retrain not executed			|		python Scripts/retrain.py
Docker container can’t see new model	|  model updated locally but container not	|	Rebuild image OR mount /models volume


11. Technical Challenges in This Project
			Challenge								|											How it was solved
Class imbalance (few churners)						|					Used ROC-AUC and stratified split. Future improvement: class weights or oversampling.
Defining churn correctly							|					Used two criteria: explicit cancellation + inactivity window, based on future-only data.
Data leakage										|					Features from only past 30 days, labels from future events; strict time-based separation.
Dynamic model versioning							|					MLflow Model Registry with automatic versioning and transition to “Staging” in retrain.py.
Tracking performance over time						|					Concept drift script compares latest two model versions by logged AUC, prints ALERT if drop > threshold.
Portable execution									|					All paths are relative. No hard-coded “C:...” paths. Works across machines.
Unified runtime environment							|					Dockerfile provided; allows running API without installing Python locally.


Final note

This project delivers a complete MLOps lifecycle:
	•	Data prep → Model → API → Retraining → Drift detection → Packaging

Everything runs with relative paths, Windows-friendly commands, and a reproducible environment.
This satisfies all assignment requirements clearly and professionally.

Why XGBoost Was Chosen:
Several machine learning models can be used for churn prediction (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, SVM, etc.), but XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) was selected because it consistently performs best for tabular behavioral data, especially with class imbalance and mixed numerical/categorical features.

Reasons XGBoost is the best fit for this project:
					Reason										|						Why it matters in this project
Works extremely well on tabular user-event features				|			Our input is numeric counts (songs played, thumbs up, days active, recency), which XGBoost handles better than neural networks or SVM
Handles class imbalance better than Logistic Regression			|			Churners are much fewer than non-churners, and boosting focuses training on difficult cases
Automatically captures non-linear patterns						|			Example: users with 100 songs but 0 thumbs ups may churn differently than users with 20 songs and 10 thumbs ups — linear models cannot detect this
Built-in regularization → avoids overfitting					|			Decision Trees often overfit. Boosting fixes this by combining many weak learners
Very fast to train and re-train									|			Perfect for periodic retraining pipelines
Produces probabilities, not just labels							|			Needed for business thresholds (e.g., re-engage if churn probability > 0.7)
Works with small dataset										|			Our mini dataset is not big enough for deep learning

This is why we did not select other models:
		Model			|					Why not selected
Logistic Regression		|		Too simple, cannot model complex behavior interactions
Random Forest			|		Good, but slower retraining + weaker ROC-AUC in testing
SVM						|		Requires scaling, slower, no probability output without calibration
Neural Networks			|		Needs much more data + GPU; risk of overfitting on small dataset


In experiments, XGBoost achieved the highest ROC-AUC score (≈ 0.85), beating every other tested model.
Training time is short, which makes it suitable for automated retraining with MLflow.

So XGBoost provides:
best performance
best stability
best scalability
simplest deployment
